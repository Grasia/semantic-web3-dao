Semantic Web3 DAO is a formalization of our proposed model for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) using [OWL 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/) Web Ontology Language and [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/).

Semantic Web3 DAO is closely aligned to [Vitalik Buterin's paper](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide). Other sources include the [Ethereum Whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/), the [official Ethereum website](https://ethereum.org/en/), [MolochDAO](https://molochdao.com/), [Aragon's blog](https://blog.aragon.org/) and [DAO Analyzer (DAOhaus platform)](https://dao-analyzer.science/daohaus).
